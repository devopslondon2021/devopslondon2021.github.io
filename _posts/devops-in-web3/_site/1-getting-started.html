<p>We will start with some understanding of the smart contract and deploying a basic “Hello World” smart contract on Ethereum node.</p>

<p>Smart contracts are computer programs that run on a blockchain. They execute automatically when certain conditions are met, without the need for a central authority or server. This makes transactions secure, transparent, and irreversible.</p>

<p>Smart contracts enable parties to trust the process without knowing each other. They automate transactions and agreements, ensuring they are carried out as intended without intermediaries like lawyers or banks. This makes them trustworthy and efficient for handling digital transactions and agreements.
Simple Analogy: The Vending Machine
Think of a smart contract like a vending machine. You put money into the machine and select an item. The machine automatically checks the amount and dispenses the item you chose. There’s no need for a shopkeeper or cashier. Similarly, a smart contract executes automatically when its conditions are met.</p>

<p>Simple Analogy: The Vending Machine
Imagine a vending machine:</p>

<p>You insert money and select an item.
The machine automatically checks the amount and dispenses the item without any human intervention.
Similarly, a smart contract automatically executes when its conditions are met. No intermediaries are needed, and the process is transparent and secure.</p>

<p>Importance of Smart Contracts
Automation: They automatically execute transactions when conditions are met.
Trust: They allow transactions between unknown parties without intermediaries.
Immutability: Once published, their code cannot be changed, ensuring consistency and reliability.</p>
