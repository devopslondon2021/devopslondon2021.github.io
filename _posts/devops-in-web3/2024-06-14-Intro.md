This guide will explain step by step how we can setup a CI/CD pipeline in Web3 project. 
If you come from web2 background and don't have any experience in web3 you can follow the guide and get the overall understanding what are the similartities and differences when it comes to setting up a robust DevOps pipeline/setup in web3. 

To keep it simple I have broken down the guide into multi sub-topics to give the gist of everything from starting to end.
