This guide will explain step by step how we can setup a CI/CD pipeline in Web3 project. 
If you come from web2 background and don't have any experience in web3 you can follow the guide and get the overall understanding what are the similartities and differences when it comes to setting up a robust DevOps pipeline/setup in web3. 

To keep it simple I have broken down the guide into multi sub-topics to give the gist of everything from starting to end.

Getting started
---------------
We will start with some understanding of the smart contract and deploying a basic "Hello World" smart contract on Ethereum node. 


### Smart Contract
#### What are smart contracts?

Smart contracts are computer programs that run on a blockchain. They execute automatically when certain conditions are met, without the need for a central authority or server. This makes transactions secure, transparent, and irreversible.

Smart contracts enable parties to trust the process without knowing each other. They automate transactions and agreements, ensuring they are carried out as intended without intermediaries like lawyers or banks. This makes them trustworthy and efficient for handling digital transactions and agreements.
Simple Analogy: The Vending Machine
Think of a smart contract like a vending machine. You put money into the machine and select an item. The machine automatically checks the amount and dispenses the item you chose. There’s no need for a shopkeeper or cashier. Similarly, a smart contract executes automatically when its conditions are met.

#### Simple Analogy: The Vending Machine
Imagine a vending machine:

You insert money and select an item.
The machine automatically checks the amount and dispenses the item without any human intervention.
Similarly, a smart contract automatically executes when its conditions are met. No intermediaries are needed, and the process is transparent and secure.


**Importance of Smart Contracts**:

- **Automation**: They automatically execute transactions when conditions are met.
- **Trust**: They allow transactions between unknown parties without intermediaries.
- **Immutability**: Once published, their code cannot be changed, ensuring consistency and reliability.

Web3 wallets
------------

Web3 wallets are digital tools that enable interaction with decentralized applications (dApps) on various blockchain platforms. Unlike traditional wallets that store currency, Web3 wallets manage cryptographic keys that prove ownership and allow users to sign transactions securely. These wallets are essential for participating in the broader ecosystem of Web3, including using cryptocurrencies, managing digital identities, and interacting with decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.

**Key Features:**
Security: They store private keys securely, often encrypted on the device or using advanced security measures like hardware isolation.
Interoperability: Many are designed to work across multiple blockchain networks.
User Control: Users have full control over their assets without the need for intermediaries.

**Popular Web3 Wallets**
**MetaMask**
A versatile browser extension and mobile wallet for Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens, enabling direct interaction with decentralized applications.
https://metamask.io/

**Trust Wallet**
A mobile wallet supporting a wide range of cryptocurrencies and features for interacting with dApps across multiple blockchains.

**Ledger Nano X**
A secure hardware wallet that supports multiple cryptocurrencies, ensuring cold storage of private keys and integration with Web3 applications.
https://www.ledger.com/

**Trezor Model T**
A pioneer in hardware wallets, offering robust security for storing private keys and supporting numerous cryptocurrencies and digital assets.
https://trezor.io/

**Coinbase Wallet**
A user-friendly wallet by Coinbase that allows full control over private keys and supports a wide variety of digital assets and dApp interactions.
