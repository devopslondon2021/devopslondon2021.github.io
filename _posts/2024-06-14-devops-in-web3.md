This guide will explain step by step how we can setup a CI/CD pipeline in Web3 project. 
If you come from web2 background and don't have any experience in web3 you can follow the guide and get the overall understanding what are the similartities and differences when it comes to setting up a robust DevOps pipeline/setup in web3. 

To keep it simple I have broken down the guide into multi sub-topics to give the gist of everything from starting to end.

Getting started
---------------
We will start with some understanding of the smart contract and deploying a basic "Hello World" smart contract on Ethereum node. 


### Smart Contract
**What are smart contracts?**

Smart contracts are computer programs that run on a blockchain. They execute automatically when certain conditions are met, without the need for a central authority or server. This makes transactions secure, transparent, and irreversible.

Smart contracts enable parties to trust the process without knowing each other. They automate transactions and agreements, ensuring they are carried out as intended without intermediaries like lawyers or banks. This makes them trustworthy and efficient for handling digital transactions and agreements.
Simple Analogy: The Vending Machine
Think of a smart contract like a vending machine. You put money into the machine and select an item. The machine automatically checks the amount and dispenses the item you chose. There’s no need for a shopkeeper or cashier. Similarly, a smart contract executes automatically when its conditions are met.

Simple Analogy: The Vending Machine
Imagine a vending machine:

You insert money and select an item.
The machine automatically checks the amount and dispenses the item without any human intervention.
Similarly, a smart contract automatically executes when its conditions are met. No intermediaries are needed, and the process is transparent and secure.

Importance of Smart Contracts
- **Automation**: They automatically execute transactions when conditions are met.
- **Trust**: They allow transactions between unknown parties without intermediaries.
- **Immutability**: Once published, their code cannot be changed, ensuring consistency and reliability.


Deploying smart contract
------------------------

This is a step-by-step introductory tutorial that will teach you how to create and deploy a smart contract on Ethereum. 

If you are new to blockchain development and don’t know where to start, or if you just want to understand how to deploy and interact with smart contracts, this guide is for you.
